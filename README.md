Global Memory Framework for MeMOS Project
-----------------------------------------

We are pursuing a new operating system in a memory-centric environment, and GiantVM(https://github.com/giantvm) is an open source suitable as a starting point in such an environment.

The followings are some patched source from GiantVM.

  - Linux-DSM-4.18: the patched host kernel from GiantVM
  - QEMU-gvm-vcpupin: the patched QEMU with vcpu pinning
